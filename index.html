        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage, in this site you will discover part of the person I am. I welcome you to my world of experience and schooling, all in one. Here you will get a glimpse at just what type of person you might be thinking of hiring. Although I am not perfect, I promise the upmost results from myself every day. No matter what I am doing I have always had a worker mindset meaning I never take any opportunity for granted and always work hard no matter what. I live off 3 key things here, Effort, Focus and Determination. <br><br>

        Throughout my years of experience one thing that many of my leaders/bosses have acknowledged me about is my ability to be a leader and be able to run things without being given any sort of directions. I will always strive to do what is best for the company/business no matter the level of difficulty. The motto I always follow is, if there is a problem there is always a solution, you just must work smarter not harder.  I always try my best to execute all tasks at a certain level of perfection in which not only myself, but my employer and customer will be satisfied. Another big plus I have to offer is my ability to speak a language other than my native one of English. I am deemed fluent in Spanish by the State of California as I was certified my senior year of High School in which I received the Seal of Biliteracy. I believe this a key skill to have nowadays as we have so many people in our State which only speak Spanish so itâ€™s always an advantage to be able to connect to customers of all cultures. <br><br>

        To conclude, this short and concise about me section let me just state that no matter what position you start me at, I am ready to work my way up as soon as possible. If you were to ask any of my previous employers how hard Iâ€™ve worked for them, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™d get some pretty good comments back because Iâ€™ve always been a guy of honesty and determination since a young age. I have excelled in school with high grades since elementary, been a leader in all my clubs and sports teams and have just tried to set an example for everyone around me no matter the age. I am ready for any and all tasks, because I know nothing will be harder than the task, we all have which is life. I will take any problem given to me and crush like no other. I have been a businessman since a young age, a straight hustler and I do not plan on stopping at all any time soon, especially with the opportunities which have been handed to me. I will not stop until all my friends and family are set, and because of that anyone that is lucky enough to employ, will thrive in any market.
